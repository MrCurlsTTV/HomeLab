# Homelab Repository

After experiencing several hardware failures, particularly with storage media, I realized how challenging and time-consuming it was to restore my homelab environment. It often took multiple days, sometimes even weeks, to get everything back to operational capacity. This was simply not acceptable. To address this, I embarked on a journey to learn Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate and streamline the process of managing and recovering my homelab.

## Components

- **`terraform/`**: Infrastructure as Code for managing Proxmox VMs.
- **`ansible/`**: Automation for VM templates and Kubernetes setup.
- **`ansible-poc/`**: Proof of concept for testing Ansible roles and playbooks.
- **`kubernetes/`**: Kubernetes manifests for cluster management.
